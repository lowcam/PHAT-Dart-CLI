This is the project plan for the Password Hash Calc in Dart CLI.
- See about upgrading SHA calculations to SHA3.
-- Need to research if SHA3 has beem implemented in Dart, within the crypto library or a different one.. 
-- https://www.dartwiki.com/wiki/SHA-3
--- This link uses the crypto library, so may be possible even though the crypto library doesn't show it on it's page
-- https://www.dartwiki.com/wiki/SHA-3_(Secure_Hash_Algorithm_3)
--- Another option using a sha3 library
-- Probably need to think about having it as an option, do you want to use
-- sha2 or sha3? That way if any pw are using sha2 can still get those hashes to match.
-- sha3 will produce a totally different hash from sha2.
