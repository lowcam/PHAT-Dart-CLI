
PHAT  - Password Hashing Algorithm Tool
CLI DART Version
v 1.0.0

The purpose of this tool is to let an individual enter text and have a hashed
output to use as the password to the site or program. Initially the program
will hash the input in SHA 256 and output in hexadecimal. The plans for this
program are to allow the selection of three different SHA lengths (256, 384
and 512). Also, the output numbering system will be selectable between
hexadecimal, base64, and base58. Also, the number of digits in the ouput
will be selectable in case a site can only have a certain number of digits
in a password. There is no copy as there wasn't a good way to get DART to
copy text to clipboard from the CLI.
